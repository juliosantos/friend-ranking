# Friend Ranking

## About

Friend Ranking is a basic demo app of some features of Facebook's Graph API. It will rank your friends according to how many Facebook likes you have in common with them.

## Context

I created this demo app to support my workshop at Social Media Week Berlin, «Fetching Open Graph Data — A Basic Introduction for Curious Developers». **Please note that the app is not to be considered production-ready.**

The app is ready for Heroku deployment, requiring 1 web dyno and 1 worker dyno. I use [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to run the background processes locally.

## Components not in version control

You will need a config/database.yml file, what with this being a Rails app and whatnot.

In order to run this locally, you will also need a config/heroku_local_env.rb file of the form:

    ENV["SENDGRID_PASSWORD"] = "..."
    ENV["SENDGRID_USERNAME"] = "..."
    ENV["APP_URL"]           = "..."
    ENV["FACEBOOK_APP_NAME"] = "..."
    ENV["FACEBOOK_APP_ID"]   = "..."
    ENV["FACEBOOK_SECRET"]   = "..."

Those same variables need to be added to the Heroku config for deployment:

    heroku config:add SENDGRID_PASSWORD=...
    heroku config:add SENDGRID_USERNAME=...
    heroku config:add FACEBOOK_APP_NAME=...
    heroku config:add FACEBOOK_APP_ID=...
    heroku config:add FACEBOOK_SECRET=...

Finally, it's important to note that the above assumes you created a Facebook app and connected it to your app.
