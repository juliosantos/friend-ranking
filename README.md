# Friend Ranking

## About

Friend Ranking is a basic demo app of some features of Facebook's Graph API. It will rank your friends according to how many Facebook likes you have in common with them.

## Context

I created this demo app to support my workshop at Social Media Week Berlin, «Fetching Open Graph Data — A Basic Introduction for Curious Developers». Please note that the app is not to be considered production-ready.

The app is ready for Heroku deployment, requiring 1 web dyno and 1 worker dyno. I use [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to run the background processes locally.

A live deployment is available at [friendrank.herokuapp.com](http://friendrank.herokuapp.com)
